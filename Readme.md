# IPL Data Analysis
This repository contains code and data for analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) matches. The code is written in Python and uses various data analysis libraries.

## Code Description

`IPL.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and batsman analysis and winner prediction.

### Dependencies

The code requires the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

Install the dependencies using `pip`:


## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis consists of multiple CSV files:

- `all_season_batting_card.csv`: Batting statistics for all seasons
- `all_season_bowling_card.csv`: Bowling statistics for all seasons
- `all_season_details.csv`: Details of all matches in all seasons
- `all_season_summary.csv`: Summary of all seasons
- `points_table.csv`: Points table for all seasons

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Upload dataset to you google drive

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `IPL.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.

4. Install the required dependencies using the provided instructions.

5. Run the code cells in the notebook to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and batsman analysis.

## Results

The code generates various visualizations and analysis results, including:

- Reading the datasets and performing data preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis, including visualizations of toss winners, toss decisions, match wins, etc.
- Analyzing the number of sixes and fours across seasons.
- Examining runs per over by teams across seasons
- Identifying the players with the maximum number of man of the match awards.
- Analyzing matches won by a team against other teams.
- Investigating matches with scores exceeding 200.
- Analyzing batsman-related statistics, such as top batsmen, individual scores, highest scores, etc.
- Comparing batsmen based on different parameters.
- Creating a batsman comparator to compare multiple batsmen.
- Visualizing the performance of top batsmen in each inning.
- Predicting match winner.

## How to Run
To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2. Download the required datasets and place them in the same directory as the notebook file.
3. Open the IPL.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Execute each cell in the notebook to run the code and visualize the results.
