RCB have got off to a good start with a win in their first match, but have since received news that Rajat Patidar is ruled out of the season. Josh Hazlewood and Wanindu Hasaranga are yet to join the squad, and Reece Topley injured himself too. David Willey should take Topley's place for this match.<br><br>KKR have signed up Jason Roy, but he won't be available for this match.

It's KKR vs RCB, a rivalry - on top off my head - known for one-sided finishes and snarky tweets aimed at each other. Here is hoping for closer finish. They can tweet snarkily all they want.</p>",

<p>A one-sided game in what was Eden Gardens' first IPL match in four years. KKR cruised to an 81-run win after hitting back from a position where everyone except Thakur had given up. Have a read of <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2023-1345038/kolkata-knight-riders-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-9th-match-1359483/match-report"">Monga's report</a> from today's play, which included RCB collapsing from 44 for 0 to 61 for 5. That's it from us tonight, as this is Himanshu signing off on behalf of Raghav, Thilak and Monga! Good night.</p><p><strong>Shardul Thakur is the Player of the Match</strong> for his match-turning 68 off 29: ""Even I don't know where it came from! Looking at the scorecard, everyone would have said we were struggling. But your subconscious mind takes over. You also have to have skills to do that at the higher level, but we also work hard in the nets. Coaching staff do the throwdowns, and give us the option of range-hitting. And you know the pitches; they always suit the batsmen, don't they? Suyash bowled exceptionally well, and we know the quality Sunil and Varun have. They have fun, take wickets. This was a perfect day""</p><p>KKR captain <strong>Nitish Rana</strong>: ""If you look at the last match, there were positives; we were in the game even after seven down. Even today, we collapsed, and credit to Gurbaz. And it was an unbelievable innings from Shardul Thakur! People will talk about Shardul, but Rinku held one end up, as we had planned. We had always planned not to give RCB batters pace in the middle overs. Suyash, playing his first match, bowled brilliant balls to such batters. Not even we have got to know him so far! He backs himself. It was always our plan to add him if we needed a third spinner.""</p><p><strong>Time for the presentations</strong></p><p>Shrikant : ""23 extras by RCB was another crime committed ""</p><p>KKR coach <strong>Chandrakant Pandit</strong>: ""It's a good win. Boys have shown the character. Looking at the initial stage, having lost wickets, and coming back to get 200-plus. We just expected the pitch to help the spinners. But you require enough runs. Shardul and Rinku counterattacked the opposition. We have seen him (Suyash) at trial matches. He is very quick in the air, and it's very tough to pick him. It's just the inexperience; but he showed a fighting attitude.""</p><p>RCB captain <strong>Faf du Plessis</strong> after the loss: ""We had it set up there in the 12th or 13th over... It was probably 20-25 runs too much. Shardul played well. Their legspinners got on top of us. It was still a good wicket... but the nature of mystery spinners is that they get wickets. They put the squeeze on us. We were pretty average with the bat. You learn lessons. Two or three days ago, you played brilliant cricket. It got away from us.""</p><p>Afeef: ""Shardul's knock will remain one of the best knocks when this season ends""</p><p><strong>11.09pm</strong> Hardly a challenge here from the Royal Challengers. KKR were 89 for 5 in the 12th over of their innings - including having Russell back in the hut - but Thakur turned the screw thereon, and how! Strangely, only three KKR batters entered double figures, but you can imagine the impact they had as their side ended at 204. Add to that not one, not two, but three mystery spinners: four wickets for Varun, three for debutant Suyash and two for Narine, and that was it. Hang around for the presentation formalities.</p>"

<p><b>11.44 pm</b> And so after four hours and 14 minutes.... your winner is the Punjab Kings by five runs. Rajasthan really gave this match away with a series of strategic blunders. The total was well within their reach, especially after conceding just seven runs off the 20th over in the first innings. But they bungled a number of things starting with the batting order followed by two reviews lost - not on lbw decisions but on attempted reversals of legal deliveries into wides/no balls.</p><p><b>Rajasthan captain Sanju Samson:</b> ""I think it was a really good track to bat on especially in the Powerplay. There was not much movement. Their batsmen came with a really positive mindset and their momentum carried on with that. Our bowlers tried varying their lengths and speed. It's a high scoring venue but we did reasonably good job pulling them back after the Powerplay start they got. [On sending Ashwin in to open] Jos was not fit. He was getting stitches for his finger after the catch. The thinking was with Padikkal, they have two spinners, a left-arm and a leggie, and we wanted a lefty out there in the middle overs. [On Jurel] It's really a pleasure. He has been with us for the last two seasons. Lots and lots of work has gone behind him. We all are really happy. When you come to the IPL, it's a one-week camp before the IPL starts but these guys put in 5 weeks of work coming to our academy facing thousands of balls. We're happy to have a batsman like that in our team. Dew, I was expecting it come in the second half of the game but it was right there in the first innings. It was a high scoring game and I think we'll be a bit more prepared in the next game.""</p><p><b>Punjab allrounder Sam Curran:</b> ""[On the final over] I think when it comes to those situations, you know if you nail your yorker, you'll be okay. Some days it works and some days it won't but luckily it was our day. I was trying to get our ball changed because it was like soap. I don't really understand why they got their ball changed but we can't. [On Prabhsimran] He's been amazing. I was with him at Punjab four years ago. He was very young and is still young. The team got off to a great start. Hopefully it's the start of a great campaign for him and the runs keep coming because he's an amazing player. The way we were playing, I was happy sitting in the dugout because the boys were playing beautifully. All that matters is that we won. [On bowling with a wet ball] It's amazingly hard. You try to train by dipping balls in water. It's incredibly hard to hold the seam. You try to bowl cross seam but it's not a natural ball to bowl a yorker cross seam. It's extremely tough but everyone has to do it so there's no real complaining. We just have to keep getting better because the batters are getting better, the bowlers are getting better and that's why this tournament is the best in the world.""</p><p><b>Punjab Kings captain Shikhar Dhawan:</b> ""There were some nervous moments but I was keeping my calm and the same with the bowlers. There was a lot of dew. The bowlers did a great job. I was happy with the score we put up. They bowled well and bowled very good yorkers. [Asked what was the turning point in the game] My switch hits? [Laughs] Scoring 197 and then my bowlers coming and getting early wickets and keeping the pressure on and then Nathan came on and got wickets. We never let the game get out of our hands. There were some moments that were hard but I think it was a great team effort. These two matches, we've gotten a great start playing well and I'm doing my best to increase my strike rate. The wicket brings momentum back quickly. This year we have a deep batting lineup so we keep momentum going hitting boundaries and put pressure on the other team. You have to respect that the other team has come to play and will bowl some good overs as well but we have to keep the intent and aggression going.""</p><p><b>Player of the Match is Nathan Ellis for his 4 for 30, including the wickets of Buttler and Samson:</b> ""It's one of those days where you can potentially bowl not your best and get rewards. There's some other guys in the team who probably deserve some rewards, but just stoked to get the win in another tight one with Rajasthan. To me it's just ball-by-ball. Each ball is a moment. I don't want to get too swept up in one over's time, five overs' time, ten overs' time. It's more about that ball's time. T20 is getting to the point where every ball counts and staying in the moment is key. Easier said than done, especially in a game like tonight. When I was bowling in the back end, I was really trying to focus on drying the ball - because it was so wet - and two to get my execution right so for me it was cross seam. I was calculating the best percentage ball for me in that time and to restrict runs. I'm stoked and really happy for Sam to get us over the line.""</p><p>That's it for our live coverage of tonight's game where I can confirm that the PUNJAB KINGS won by five runs. Come back tomorrow (or is it today? It's now 12:12 am in India with the post-match presentation ending after midnight) for some more IPL action. Until then, take care!</p>"

There are a couple of parts on the wicket that are very dry, they are still hard, though and they will not have a huge influence. 165 is the average score here. The trend so far in the IPL has been to chase, but personally, I would not be against batting first, putting a big total and then put pressure on the teams.</p><p><strong>6.50pm</strong> In other news, KKR's Shreyas Iyer and RCB's Rajat Patidar have been ruled out of IPL 2023.

<p>Here's Sarfaraz: It has been raining in Delhi over the last few days, so the outfield has changed, and there was grass on the surface and some movement. There is uneven bounce too. Not very easy for the batters. We need early wickets. Good score on this surface. We need to bowl well with the new ball. A little bit of dew. But we need to play good cricket. </p><p><b>9.21pm </b>A middling total at best from Delhi, but they have something and the surface has looked spicy. They finish on 162 for 8, the lowest total so far in the IPL for a team batting first. Delhi's batters did not have the best of days. None of them could get in, bar maybe Axar Patel who scored 36 off 22 balls. David Warner was lucky for his 32-ball 37 while Sarfaraz had a tough day as he scored 30 off 34. The Titans bowlers were on the mark all through the innings. There was a lot of movement available early on, that caused a few extras, but the bowlers came back well. Mohammed Shami and Rashid Khan picked three wickets apiece. Alzarri Joseph was at his fiery best picking 2 for 29, and was on a hat-trick at one point. Can the Delhi pacers rattle the Titans batting unit? Join Sudarshanan in a bit to find out.</p>"

They knew their dream wouldn't become a reality immediately - Archer was not available for the 2022 season. But now with Bumrah out with a back injury, they will have to wait for yet another season.

This run has also coincided with them not playing at their home ground, M Chinnaswamy Stadium - theirs is one of the poorest home records for an IPL team.

Tilak batted well. We kept backing ourselves. Faf went first, and I joined later. I am very happy with how things went today. The new ball was a bit tricky, but we shifted the momentum by taking them down with the new ball. We nullified all their intensity. The wicket was quite a nice one. We hit good areas and kept putting pressure on the bowlers. [Crowd] Phenomenal, was a packed crowd. Every seat was full and we knew we would get  a lot of support. We just ride off that intensity from the crowd They were right behind us. [On Karn Sharma] He was phenomenal, when he got that left-hander out, that was great bowling. He was bowling so well last year. He was ready to play. Even in the nets, he was not getting hit for sixes. He put us on the front foot right away. The first game of the IPL, and to perform like that was great. Apart from Mumbai winning five times and Chennai four times, we have qualified the most number of times, so we do play consistent cricket. It's just about staying focused, and just try to be the best balanced team. We need to play on this momentum. We just need to execute better. </p><p><b>Rohit Sharma</b>: Didn't have a great start but was a good effort from Tilak at the end. But the bowlers didn't bowl well. We didn't bat good enough, it was a good pitch. [On Tilak] Some of the shorts he played today, he showed a lot of courage. We wanted to be courageous enough, and hats off to Tilak for getting us to the total. Was a good pitch to bat on. We did not bat to our potential. 30-40 runs would have been ideal. We were struggling t play the catch-up game. [No Bumrah] For the past six-eight months I am used to play without Bumrah. We can't control things which we can't control. The other guys are also talented. A lot of the guys haven't played IPL before. First game of the season, lot to look forward to.</p><p>Afeef: ""A perfect return to the Chinnaswamy ""</p><p>Shrikant : ""I liked the move to send DK though it has not worked out. RCB is keeping an eye on NRR early on ""</p><p>Neeraj : ""Kohi wanted his own 'finishes off in style' moment...""</p><p><b>11.08pm</b> Everything that could have gone right for RCB, did. Everything that could have wrong for Mumbai, did. Think that's the best way to put. Mumbai, bar Tilak Varma were all over the place, and still got to 171. But RCB openers, Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis just showed how good a surface that was. The duo added 148 runs off 89 balls to set-up the chase. Kohli remained unbeaten on 82 off 49, while du Plessis scored 73 off 43. RCB mopped up the win in just 16.2 overs and that will give their net run-rate a boost.</p>"

It is about playing what is in front of us and focussing on the here and now. He (Holder) brings some good balance with the bat and the ball - it is fantastic to have in T20 cricket. The Impact Player rule adds another dynamic. Disappointing for him (Prasidh Krishna) to be injured but it gives someone else an opportunity to step up. (On importance of playing spin) Very important. It has been a prevalent part in T20 cricket wherever you play so it is exciting to play in different venues and in different venues - that is part of what makes the IPL special. </p><p><strong>Sunrisers Hyderabad XI:</strong> Abhishek Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Harry Brook, Glenn Phillips (wk), Washington Sundar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar (c), Adil Rashid, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Umran Malik, T Natarajan</p><p><strong>Rajasthan Royals XI:</strong> Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder, R Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Trent Boult, KM Asif</p><p><strong>3pm</strong> Time for the toss.

The pitch looks pristine and according to Sanjay Manjrekar, it looks very much like an English pitch - white in colour with an even covering of dry grass.

SRH, meanwhile, stitched together a superb mid-season run last campaign, only to lose steam when it really mattered. Both teams have had a chance to plug the holes that surfaced in 2022, and on paper, <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2023-1345038/sunrisers-hyderabad-vs-rajasthan-royals-4th-match-1359478/match-preview"">seem better placed</a> to go the distance than they did twelve months ago. </p><p>SRH, though, will have to contend with the unavailability of a few key players today. Aiden Markram (their captain), Heinrich Klaasen and Marco Jansen are currently on national duty. But in Harry Brook, Glenn Phillips, Mayank Agarwal and Rahul Tripathi, they have more than enough firepower to offset it. Keep an eye out for Abhishek Sharma too, who seems to have grown in stature over the past couple of years. </p><p>RR, meanwhile, would be hoping that their explosive batting unit comes to the party again. Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson and Yashasvi Jaiswal can tee off from the outset, and with Shimron Hetmyer adding impetus in the middle order, they seem to have most of their batting bases covered. </p><p>This, however, is also a contest between two strong bowling units. SRH have packed their bowling attack with top-quality Indian pacers - each of whom have a point to prove. RR are missing Prasidh Krishna but have arguably the best spin-bowling contingent at the IPL. </p><p><strong>2:25pm</strong> Three games into the season and we have already had several talking points. It began with <a href=""https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2023-gt-vs-csk-motera-goes-yellow-in-anticipation-of-dhoni-s-last-dance-1365997"">Ahmedabad being painted yellow</a>, and Hardik Pandya getting the better of MS Dhoni. </p><p>Yesterday, we had rain-induced drama in the afternoon fixture, before Mark Wood produced a storm of his own to blow the Delhi Capitals away. Today, the caravan moves to Hyderabad, where the Sunrisers Hyderabad would hope to become the fourth team to register a home win at the first time of asking. But they will have to do so against Rajasthan Royals, who were last season's finalists. </p><p>Hello and welcome to our coverage, this is Shashwat Kumar and I will be your eyes and ears for everything that happens.

That's all we have for you tonight, but we will be back before you even get a chance to miss us as tomorrow is a double header. See you then.</p><p><b>Midnight</b> The Player of the Match is <b>Rashid Khan</b>. He says: ""So happy to get the Man of the Match. Gives me so much of energy for the rest of the competition. Bowling to the leftie was hard but the more I keep it tight, it is better. I had it in my mind to keep it simple. Just bowl the right areas consistently. Batting is all about time spent in the nets. The kind of opportunity and confidence in me by the coaching staff and the captain does give me a lot of batting time in the nets. It helps me in the middle.""</p><p><b>11.55pm</b> We will soon be into day of this match with the presentation not yet done. <b>Hardik Pandya</b> says: ""I am obviously very happy, but we did put ourselves in a difficult position. We were very happy with 178 because at one point they looked like going past 200. But we kept getting wickets. Having the impact rule makes my job very difficult. There are too many options. Because of it, someone will always bowl less or late. My shot and Shubman's shot put the team in a difficult position. We have some standards inside the dressing room. We have to finish the games, and not Rash and Rahul all the time.""  </p><p><b>11.45pm</b> ""We were slightly short,"" says <b>MS Dhoni</b>, the losing captain. ""Another 15-20 runs would have been good. We all know there would be a little bit of dew. Also it was a 7.30pm start so the ball holds on a little early on. Also we could have batted properly in the middle overs as opposed to trying to muscle the ball. Rutu is a pleasure to watch. He has groomed himself very well, and makes the eight decisions under pressure. We can't afford to bowl no-balls. That is something in our control."" </p><p><b>11.38pm</b> That's a pretty comfortable win for the defending champions, GT. Led by Rashid Khan with the ball, they restricted CSL to 20 short of a par score, and then chased it down fairly easily. In the end, two blows from Rashid Khan turned a possibly tight finish to a walk in the park in the last over. The win will be extra sweet because they couldn't use their Impact Player properly thanks to the injury to Kane Williamson when fielding. The pace of the match hasn't been great with more than four hours taken</p>"
